# Support and Opposition by Demographic

News and polling organizations will sometimes release data with a few visualizations. I appreciate these, but they aren't always the visualization I want. Given the importance of party ID in the American political system, I usually want to see, for a given issue X, "what do Democrats vs. Republicans vs. independents think of X?" Sometimes I'm also curious as to breakdown along race, gender, education, or similar demographic lines.

This repo contains R and Python code specifically adapted to make nice-looking visualizations to do such cross-sectional comparisons. It is not a general-purpose poll visualizer, but it does this one well-defined task well.
